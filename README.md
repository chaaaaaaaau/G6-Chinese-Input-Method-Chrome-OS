2019/2020 CityU CDE FYP done by CHAU Kwun Wai, supervised by Dr L.M. PO

This Project is a Chrome Extension developed for Chrome OS! Input Method would be added to Language Menu in Chrome OS once it is loaded to chrome://extensions.

The G6 Chinese Input Method is a stroke-based Chinese input method invented in the past decade.
It encodes Chinese characters and phrases by using at most six radicals and strokes with encoding rules to ensure typing efficiency.
In this project, Google Chrome OS is taken as a target operating system for application development as there is a lack of stroke-based Chinese Input Method available in this market.

The system is developed as a Chrome Extension Application.
Related properties like pop-up window, context menu, storage capabilities and input-method editor (IME) provided by Chrome APIs maintain a communication platform between the system and users to enhance the user experience through Interactions conducted.
On top of general rules of the G6 Chinese Input Method, typing features like Single Hand Typing, Word Prediction, Adaptive Ranking, Word Dictionary and My Favourite Collection are developed during the implementation as some further assistances to users in order to increase the effectiveness of typing process based on personal habits.
