                The G6 Chinese Input Method is a stroke-based Chinese input method 
                invented in the past decade. It encodes Chinese characters and phrases 
                by using at most six radicals and strokes with encoding rules to ensure 
                typing efficiency. In this project, Google Chrome OS is taken as a target 
                operating system for application development as there is a lack of 
                stroke-based Chinese Input Method available in this market.
                
                <br><br>
                
                The system is developed as a Chrome Extension Application. Related 
                properties like pop-up window, context menu, storage capabilities and
                input-method editor (IME) provided by Chrome APIs maintain a 
                communication platform between the system and users to enhance the user
                experience through Interactions conducted. On top of general rules of
                the G6 Chinese Input Method, typing features like Single Hand Typing,
                Word Prediction, Adaptive Ranking, Word Dictionary and My Favourite
                Collection are developed during the implementation as some further
                assistances to users in order to increase the effectiveness of typing
                process based on personal habits.
